    <p>Fixing a bug detected during unit testing costs 10 times more than correcting it during coding, and up to 40 times more than during system testing. Therefore, the earlier security is implemented in the software development cycle, the better.</p>
    
    <p>Vulnerabilities in code can open doors to cyberattacks, compromising sensitive data and damaging an organization's reputation. Secure code review is an essential practice, allowing identification and correction of flaws before they become significant problems.</p>
    
    <h2>How Code Review is Conducted</h2>
    <p>Code review involves examining a software's source code to ensure it complies with best coding and security practices. This process helps detect errors that could lead to security vulnerabilities and promotes software quality, enhancing its reliability and efficiency.</p>
    
    <p>Effective reviews save time and money, identifying flaws and areas for improvement before code deployment. This prevents defects in the software and negative impacts on the production environment, saving resources by avoiding the need for later corrections.</p>
    
    <p>Code review can be done manually by other developers or automatically using specialized tools. Manual review involves peer analysis, promoting collective learning and continuous codebase improvement. Automated tools like SAST (Static Application Security Testing), DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing), and IAST (Interactive Application Security Testing) efficiently scan code for known vulnerability patterns.</p>
    
    <h2>SAST, DAST, and IAST: When to Use?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><b>SAST:</b> Analyzes static source code to identify vulnerabilities without executing the program. Best used in the early development stages to detect problems before code execution.</li>
      <li><b>DAST:</b> Tests the running application, simulating attacks to find vulnerabilities. Ideal for later stages of the development lifecycle, providing a realistic view of the application's security in a simulated production environment.</li>
      <li><b>IAST:</b> Combines SAST and DAST approaches, offering real-time analysis of the application while it is running. This allows more accurate vulnerability detection in context.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Step-by-Step for Bug Hunters</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1. Establish clear objectives: Define what you expect to find in the review, such as specific vulnerabilities or poor coding practices.</li>
      <li>2. Use code analysis tools: SAST, DAST, and IAST tools can automate the detection of common vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li>3. Conduct manual reviews: In addition to tools, manual review allows a deeper understanding of business logic and possible flaws.</li>
      <li>4. Document everything: Keep a detailed record of found vulnerabilities and correction recommendations.</li>
      <li>5. Report: Communicate the vulnerability to the responsible code owners and provide necessary information for fixing it.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Secure code review is an indispensable step in software development, crucial for ensuring the security and quality of applications. Through appropriate practices and tools, developers and bug hunters can identify and help remediate vulnerabilities, protecting organizations from potential cyber threats. Adopting this practice not only improves the final product but also fosters a culture of security and excellence among development teams.</p>
