    <p>Penetration testing teams protect an organization's systems by simulating controlled attacks to identify and fix vulnerabilities before they can be exploited. Test notebooks assist these teams by providing organized procedures for consistent and comprehensive testing.</p>
    
    <p>These tests are conducted systematically, using a variety of techniques and tools to exploit potential weak points in the security infrastructure. After execution, the Security Operations Center (SOC) analyzes the results to verify whether it was possible to identify and mitigate the attacks.</p>
    
    <p>This article provides a detailed overview of the methodology for developing effective test notebooks. Throughout the text, we will explore key concepts related to cybersecurity and discuss how penetration testing can be a proactive measure for cyber defense. We will also provide insights to strengthen an organization's security posture.</p>
    
    <p>See the company from the attacker's perspective. The Red Team of Ethical Hackers from GuardTech conducts controlled tests and offers a view of the company's cybersecurity that wouldn't be possible by any other method. Highlight how identified vulnerabilities can be exploited in a real attack, understand how these flaws can be fixed, and how attacks can be blocked, detected, and responded to. Talk to one of our specialists.</p>

    <h2>Understanding the company's needs</h2>
    <p>To start developing the test notebook, it is necessary to understand the specific requirements of the organization. This involves visualizing not only the technological environment but also the security needs and associated business objectives. Everything is adapted by cybersecurity professionals in the test notebook to meet the particularities of the evaluated environment.</p>

    <h2>Defining objectives and scope</h2>
    <p>To outline the scope of the test, it is necessary to understand the limitations and areas that will be addressed during the simulations. The tests will be conducted on a machine or a set of specific systems within the company. This allows assessing whether the SOC team's monitoring tools can identify suspicious or malicious activities during the penetration tests.</p>

    <h2>Execution and analysis</h2>
    <p>After developing and defining the scope of the test notebook, the next step is the execution and analysis of the results. In this phase, guidelines are provided on how to conduct the tests using the developed notebook and how to analyze the results to identify potential vulnerabilities and areas for improvement in system security.</p>

    <h3>Let's briefly explore the scope of some tests:</h3>

    <h4>1) Analyzing network packets</h4>
    <p>This command is used to analyze network traffic, allowing understanding of how the organization's network functions. By capturing and examining data packets, it is possible to identify communication patterns, detect network problems, and check for the presence of sensitive information, such as authentication, DHCPv6, and domains.</p>

    <h4>2) DNS enumeration</h4>
    <p>Aims to identify and list the DNS records of assets on the network, providing information about available services and resources accessible through domain names.</p>

    <h4>3) Identifying Active Directories</h4>
    <p>Used to detect the presence of Active Directory services in the company's environment, facilitating the identification of domains, domain controllers, and other related components.</p>

    <h4>4) Extracting information from Active Directories via DHCPv6</h4>
    <p>Seeks to extract specific information from Active Directory services through DHCPv6, such as network configurations, IP address assignments, and other relevant data.</p>

    <h4>5) Identifying active SMBs</h4>
    <p>Aims to identify active Server Message Block (SMB) services on the network, providing information about file shares and printers available for access.</p>

    <h4>6) Identifying SMBs with Null Session active</h4>
    <p>Used to identify SMB services that allow null sessions, which can represent a potential security vulnerability.</p>

    <h4>7) Identifying hosts and open ports</h4>
    <p>Identifies hosts and open network ports in the client's environment, both remotely and locally, providing insights into the potential attack surface.</p>

    <h4>8) Executing the Mimikatz file</h4>
    <p>Attempts to execute the malicious Mimikatz file, known for its ability to extract credentials from Windows systems in memory, enabling the capture of sensitive credentials.</p>

    <h4>9) Dumping the LSASS file with credentials</h4>
    <p>Attempts to dump the LSASS file, which contains credentials in memory, allowing an attacker to capture this sensitive information for later use in credential attacks.</p>

    <h4>10) Changing the machine's policy to grant special privileges to regular users</h4>
    <p>If it is possible to change the machine's security policies, this can result in a compromise of the system's security.</p>

    <h4>11) Simulating ransomware activity with a PowerShell script</h4>
    <p>Uses a basic PowerShell script to simulate ransomware activity on the machine, such as encrypting files and demanding a ransom.</p>

    <h4>12) Removing security logs from Windows Event Viewer</h4>
    <p>Removing security logs from the Event Viewer can be done to hide malicious activities and make intrusion detection more difficult.</p>

    <h4>13) Disabling the local user's firewall</h4>
    <p>Disables the local user's firewall, making the system more vulnerable to external attacks and potentially allowing malware to enter the network.</p>

    <h4>14) Attempting credential dumps using malicious files</h4>
    <p>Attempts to dump credentials using malicious tools such as WCE (Windows Credential Editor), which can extract and display stored credentials on a Windows system.</p>

    <p>By performing these tests, cybersecurity professionals can identify potential vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of the implemented security controls. Analyzing the results obtained during the tests is essential to provide valuable insights that can be used to strengthen the system's security posture and mitigate potential threats.</p>

    <h2>Reporting and recommendations</h2>
    <p>The SOC team will conduct a thorough analysis of the commands identified during the tests. Additionally, they will create specific rules to identify and capture commands that went unnoticed during the penetration tests. This information will be compiled into a comprehensive report, providing a detailed view of the findings and recommendations to improve the organization's security posture.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The methodology presented in this article offers insights into understanding business needs, defining objectives and scope, executing and analyzing tests, and preparing detailed reports with recommendations for mitigating identified vulnerabilities. By following this methodological approach, penetration testing teams can conduct tests consistently, comprehensively, and aligned with the specific needs of the client.</p>

    <p>It is important to emphasize the crucial role of the SOC team in analyzing the test results and implementing additional security measures based on the findings. The collaborative work between penetration testing teams and the SOC is essential to ensure a robust and proactive security posture in the face of constantly evolving cyber threats.</p>
